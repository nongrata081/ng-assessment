By default if no tests are specified for app / lib it will pass.\n\nng test shipping\nng test shipping-e2e\nng test shipping-backend\nng test data\nng test ui-components\n\nUnit testing of all apps & libs is done automatically on pre-push.\nRun npm run affected:test to execute the unit tests affected by a change.\nCoverage\nIn order to test coverage of all apps & libs run npm run test:coverage\nResults are available in coverage/ dir in root.\nCoverage is checked while unit-testing the app in pre-push (will fail if unit tests don't meet coverage thresholds).\nCoverage thresholds are setup in jest.config.js :\n\nbranches: 100\nfunctions: 100\nlines: 100\nstatements: -10\n\nE2E tests\nRun ng e2e my-app to execute the end-to-end tests via Cypress.\nRun npm run affected:e2e to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.\nBy default e2e tests are automatically run on pre-push.\nConsistent code style\nConsistent code style is enforced with Prettier.\nSettings are available in .prettierignore & .prettierrc\nTo prettify the codebase manually, run npm run prettify\nExecuted automatically on:\n\npre-commit\npre-push\nin ci\n\nApplication shell\nRun npm run build:shell to build the shipping angular app with app shell.\nTo verify that app shell was built successfully check the contents of dist/apps/shipping/index.html\nto contain rendered contents of apps/shipping/src/app/app-shell/.\nFor profiling open the shipping app in chrome and in Performance tab hit Shift + Cmd + E.\nHMR\nIn order to start the shipping front-end app with hot module replacement enabled, run npm run shipping:hmr\nThe web-page will reflect occurring changes in the code without live-reload (page refresh).\nBuild\nRun ng build  to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nSSR\nTo verify that SSR works, run:\n\nnpm run ssr to build client and server and serve with server-side rendering\nUI at http://localhost:4000/\nAPI at http://localhost:4000/api\n\n\ncurl http://localhost:4000/ > shipping.html that will put all the contents of the retrieved html file\nvia http request to curl.html in the root.\n\nAll contents of the app component will be rendered to retrieved html file. If you do the same with\nnpm run start the retrieved html file will only contain  element but not its content.\nShared UI-components library\nMultiple front-end apps might be consuming reusable shared UI-components. Reusing shared UI-components with\nwell-defined APIs will make development and delivery of domain related value easier & faster. Thus shared\nUI-components should be placed into ui-components library, located at libs/ui-components.\n\nto lint data library run ng lint ui-components\nto test data library run ng test ui-components\n\nShared data library\nFront-end and back-end apps should use as much shared code, as possible, in order to prevent diverging of the code\nfor same entities in FE and BE, which will make the entire app more error-prone eventually. Thus for keeping shared\ncode between FE and BE apps there is a lintable & testable data library, located at libs/data.\n\nto lint data library run ng lint data\nto test data library run ng test data\n\nBrowser compatibility\nConfiguration for browser compatibility are set in package.json in \"browserslist\". Current options are to support last 2 versions of browsers with > 1% share.\nBudgets\nCustom budgets for the entire shipping app size are set to the following options in angular.json:\n\nbaseline = 750kb\nmaximumWarning = 200kb\nmaximumError = 400kb\n\nDeploy to gh-pages\nDeployed app will be available at https://nongrata081.github.io/ng-assessment/\nIn order to deploy to gh-pages make sure that in dist/ directory root built bundles with index.html are present.\nInstall angular-cli-ghpages\nnpm i -g angular-cli-ghpages\nBuild the app\nng build prod\nPublish to gh ngh\nDependency graph\nRun npm run dep-graph to generate & open the graph of dependencies in the workspace.\nRun npm run affected:dep-graph to see the graph of affected entities in the app\n(since retesting & rebuilding everything always will not be scalable and will take too much time).\nCI/CD\n.travis.yml has next steps for travis ci:\n\ncommit lint\nlint\nunit test\ne2e\n\nBundle analyze\nnpm run build:stats to build the shipping app with stats.json files for es5 & es2015\nnpm run analyze:bundle:es5 to use webpack-bundle-analyzer for es5 bundle stats\nnpm run analyze:bundle:es2015 to use webpack-bundle-analyzer for es2015 bundle stats\nStyleguide / UI components library app\nIs implemented with Storybook.\nConfig files available at .storybook/\nnpm run storybook to run the app\nnpm run build-storybook to build static files, output dir by default storybook-static/\n\nThis project was generated using Nx.\n\n\n&#x1F50E; Nx is a set of Angular CLI power-ups for modern development.\nQuick Start & Documentation\nNx Documentation\n30-minute video showing all Nx features\nInteractive Tutorial\nAdding capabilities to your workspace\nNx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.\nThese capabilities include generating applications, libraries, .etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.\nBelow are some plugins which you can add to your workspace:\n\nAngular\nng add @nrwl/angular\n\n\nReact\nng add @nrwl/react\n\n\nWeb (no framework frontends)\nng add @nrwl/web\n\n\nNest\nng add @nrwl/nest\n\n\nExpress\nng add @nrwl/express\n\n\nNode\nng add @nrwl/node\n\n\n\nGenerate an application\nRun ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app to generate an application.\n\nYou can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.\n\nWhen using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.\nGenerate a library\nRun ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib to generate a library.\n\nYou can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.\n\nLibraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from @ng-assessment/mylib.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve my-app for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng g component my-component --project=my-app to generate a new component.\nFurther help\nVisit the Nx Documentation to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
